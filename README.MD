#Websensors
A quick proof of concept using AppJS and the Firefox-Mobile Device-API to read some of the sensors in a 
smartphone and display them in a nice webapp.

Tested on Firefox for Android on 5.1.1.

##Files
- index.html: main HTML file which loads the different librarys and which provides the UI
- pages.js: javascript file for handling page-clicks and reading the specified sensor data
- styles.css: used to style the compass image on the "Device Orientation" page
